# Set Assignment

In order to run this assignment you will need python 3.7 or greater. It should work with any older versions of python as well but those have not been tested.

Pull up a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the files. Run the following command: python SET.py

Alternatively, if you are on windows or mac, you can double click the file SET.py and it will run

# Normal Game

In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a set. For each one of the four categories of features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as a) either all the same, or b) all different.
For example, 3 solid orange diamonds, 2 solid green circles, and 1 solid blue squares form a set, because the shadings of the three cards are all the same, while the numbers, the colors, and the shapes among the three cards are all different.

Click on any card to select the card. Select three cards that make up a set. If it does make a set, the cards will be removed and new cards will be drawn from the deck. If they are not a set, a sound will play and the cards will be unselected. If the there are no more sets available and there are still cards in the deck, three extra cards will be shown at the bottom of the screen. Once a new set has been found, these cards will be removed and you will be back down to 12 cards. If there are no more sets available and there are no more cards in the deck then the game will end. 

The hint button will show you one of the cards that can form a set.

To start a new game, press the new game button at the bottom of the screen. To start a new timed game, press the timed game button at the bottom of the screen.

# Timed Game

This version works the same as the normal game but you are racing against the clock. Once the timer hits the bottom, the game will be over. The timer will get reset every time you find a set. The timer gets progressively faster the more sets you find. Try to find as many sets as you can before the timer runs out. If you complete an entire deck, a new one will be given to you and you can keep going.
